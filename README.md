CS164 is about mainly about compilers and programming language basics. We implemented the lexer, parser, semantic analyzer and code generator for the compiler of COOL(Classroom Object Oriented Language). The semantic analyzer and code generator are much more difficult than lexer and parser. COOL doesn't support lambda functions though, which is an interesting area for me to probe into later.
